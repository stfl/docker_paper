Recently, the lightweight virtualization technologies claim to offer superior performance. In this paper, we present a detailed performance comparison of traditional hypervisor based virtualization and new lightweight solutions. In our measurements, we use several benchmarks tools in order to understand the strengths, weaknesses, and anomalies introduced by these different platforms in terms of processing, storage, memory and network. Our results show that containers achieve generally better performance when compared with traditional virtual machines and other recent solutions. Albeit containers offer clearly more dense deployment of virtual machines, the performance difference with other technologies is in many cases relatively small.},

This entity controls and manages the Android instances and provides an interface for remote administration and management of the device and its software. We provide an administrative solution for dynamically modifying, removing or adding multiple Android instances remotely and locally. Furthermore, we present a secure device provisioning and enrollment solution for our system. Our approach includes several security extensions for secure network access, integrity protection of data on storage devices, and secure access to the touchscreen of mobile devices. Our implementation requires only minimal modification to the software stack of a typical Android-based smartphone, which allows easy porting to other devices when compared to other virtualization techniques. Practical tests show the feasibility of our approach regarding runtime overhead and battery lifetime impact.},

  title = {An Infrastructure Agnostic Application Deployment Framework for the {{Internet}} of Things},
  abstract = {ger: In den letzten Jahren wurden Begriffe wie Smart Grid, Smart City, oder Smart Vehicles immer popul\"arer. Sie fallen alle unter das Konzept des Internet der Dinge (IoT). Sch\"atzungen zufolge werden im Jahr 2020 bis zu 34 Milliarden Ger\"ate mit dem Internet verbunden sein. Das gro\ss{}e Potenzial von IoT ist mit vielen Herausforderungen verbunden. Neben Aspekten wie Privatsph\"are, Sicherheit, Skalierbarkeit, etc., ist die Infrastruktur des IoT ein erhebliches Problem. Die gro\ss{}e Anzahl an unterschiedlichen Ger\"aten f\"uhrt zu einem sehr heterogenen Umfeld. Die Entwicklung von Applikationen, welche diese heterogene Infrastruktur ber\"ucksichtigt, wird dadurch \"au\ss{}erst komplex und fehleranf\"allig. Eine m\"ogliche L\"osung f\"ur dieses Problem ist durch Virtualisierung die Plattform zu abstrahieren. Im Zuge dieser Diplomarbeit wird die Verwendung von Betriebssystemvirtualisierung in Verbindung mit dieser heterogenen Umgebung untersucht. In diesem Zusammenhang werden h\"aufig verwendete IoT Ger\"ate vorgestellt. Zudem erfolgt eine detaillierte Beschreibung der Virtualisierung in verschiedenen Betriebssystemen (z.B.: Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, Windows). Neben der Vorstellung von aktuellen Container Engines mit Fokus auf Linux, wird auch das Konzept der Continuous Delivery erl\"autert. Zur Demonstrierung der Anwendbarkeit der Betriebssystemvirtualisierung im Kontext von IoT, wird ein Application Deployment Framework entwickelt. Dieses Framework bietet die M\"oglichkeit Applikationen mit einem Klick zu verteilen und einzusetzen. Zus\"atzlich erlaubt es das Einsetzen auf verschiedenen CPU-Architekturen (z.B.: ARM, x86) und vereinfacht die Integrierung in eine bereits vorhandene Continuous Delivery Pipeline durch eine REST API. Die Funktionen des Frameworks werden durch den Einsatz eines Geb\"audemanagementsystems veranschaulicht. Im letzten Teil der Diplomarbeit, wird die Verwendung von verschiedenen Applikationen auf unterschiedlichen Ger\"aten hinsichtlich der Realisierbarkeit und Anwendbarkeit des vorgestellten Ansatzes evaluiert und diskutiert.; eng: In the last years terms like Smart Grid, Smart City or Smart Vehicle, became increasingly popular. They all fall under the conception of the so called Internet of Things (IoT). It is estimated that in 2020 will be up to 34 billion devices connected with the Internet. However, the huge potentials of IoT come with various challenges. Among issues like privacy, security, scalability, etc., the infrastructure in IoT is a significant problem. The huge amount of different devices leads to a highly heterogeneous environment. Thus, developing applications that respect these heterogeneous infrastructures is exceedingly complex and in further consequence very error prone. A possible solution to this problem is to abstract the platform through virtualization. In the course of this thesis we investigate how operating-system-level virtualization can be used to cope with the heterogeneous environment. Therefore, commonly used IoT devices are presented and an in-depth explanation of how operating-system-level virtualization is implemented on different operating systems (e.g., Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, Windows) is given. Furthermore, currently available container engines with focus on Linux are introduced and compared. We also explain the concept of continuous delivery, and why this development approach facilitates agile development. To show the feasibility of operating-system-level virtualization in the context of IoT, a prototype of an application deployment framework is developed. This framework provides distribution and deployment of applications within one click. Furthermore, it allows to deploy on different CPU-architectures (e.g., ARM, x86) transparently to the user. Additionally, it can easily be integrated within a continuous delivery pipeline through a REST API. The features of the framework are demonstrated via the deployment of a Building Managament System (BMS). In the last part of the thesis, the deployment time of different applications on various devices is evaluated and discussed, which shows both, feasibility and applicability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Today, a new technology is going to change the way platforms for the internet of services are designed and managed. This technology is called container (e.g. Docker and LXC). The internet of service industry is adopting the container technology both for internal usage and as commercial offering. The use of container as base technology for large-scale systems opens many challenges in the area of resource management at run-time, for example: autoscaling, optimal deployment and monitoring. Specifically, monitoring of container based systems is at the ground of any resource management solution, and it is the focus of this work. This paper explores the tools available to measure the performance of Docker from the perspective of the host operating system and of the virtualization environment, and it provides a characterization of the CPU and disk I/O overhead introduced by containers.},

  title = {The Impact of {{Docker}} Containers on the Performance of Genomic Pipelines},
  abstract = {$<$p$>$Genomic pipelines consist of several pieces of third party software and, because of their experimental nature, frequent changes and updates are commonly necessary thus raising serious deployment and reproducibility issues. Docker containers are emerging as a possible solution for many of these problems, as they allow the packaging of pipelines in an isolated and self-contained manner. This makes it easy to distribute and execute pipelines in a portable manner across a wide range of computing platforms. Thus, the question that arises is to what extent the use of Docker containers might affect the performance of these pipelines. Here we address this question and conclude that Docker containers have only a minor impact on the performance of common genomic pipelines, which is negligible when the executed jobs are long in terms of computational time.$<$/p$>$},

Performance evaluation of Containers and virtual machines provides to practitioners and system administrators information about the quality of the services provisioned for virtualization. The main goal of this paper is to conduct a comparative study of the performance evaluation of virtual machines and containers. In order to accomplish this, a methodology is proposed to evaluate the performance of Docker containers and virtual machines. Additionally, a real-world case study is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach. For all the experiments, the Docker container shown lower execution times for the requests against virtual machine.},

In traditional cloud infrastructures, hypervisors like KVM create and manage Virtual Machines according to users' demands. Recently a more lightweight virtualization technique is being rapidly adopted and it is based on containers. Although running a container on top of Virtual Machine is a common case, according to our research it has never been studied before how this affects the container's performance. In this work, we conducted several experiments to study how the container performance is affected by the additional virtualization layer of the Virtual Machine. We used Docker to deploy and run our containers, KVM hypervisor for the Virtual Machines and we executed a series of well-known benchmarks on different operating systems.},

  abstract = {Virtualization is a mature technology which has shown to provide computing resource and cost optimization while enabling consolidation, isolation and hardware abstraction through the concept of virtual machine. Recently, by sharing the operating system resources and simplifying the deployment of applications, containers are getting a more and more popular alternative to virtualization for specific use cases. As a result, today these two technologies are competing to provide virtual instances for cloud computing, Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), High Performance Computing (HPC), avionic and automotive platforms. In this paper, the performance of the most important open source hypervisor (KVM and Xen) and container (Docker) solutions are compared on the ARM architecture, which is rapidly emerging in the server world. The extensive system and Input/Output (I/O) performance measurements included in this paper show a slightly better performance for containers in CPU bound workloads and request/response networking; conversely, thanks to their caching mechanisms, hypervisors perform better in most disk I/O operations and TCP streaming benchmark.},
